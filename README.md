# Azure_Sensor_Communication
The biggest challenge this time around was fumbling through all the extensions. It took a while for me to find 
out what needs to be installed where and on what platform, but once it clicked, the code worked fine and the
IoT connection was seamless. One thing I liked about this lab was the use of Visual Studio. Since most things
in this class have been new to me, it was nice navigating something more familiar.
